                  Bouncing ball models are hybrid dynamic systems with the Zeno phenomenon. Zeno behavior is informally characterized by an infinite number of events occurring in a finite time interval for certain hybrid systems. As the ball loses energy, a large number of collisions with the ground start occurring in successively smaller intervals of time.",
